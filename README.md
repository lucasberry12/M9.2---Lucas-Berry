# CS408 - Lab9.2

Author: Lucas Berry

## Overview

This project is a modification of the already existing cs408-lab-9 repo, with
modifications to enable the user to control a ball on the screen and play a game with it.
The game is very similar to slither.io. The user can use the WASD keys to move the ball
around and "eat" the other circles flying across the screen. In the top right there is a counter
showing how many more balls are left in the game.

To play the game start by typing this into the console:

```
npm install
```

After that, open the index.html file. From there you can play the game. To restart the game, simply close the tab and reopen it.
